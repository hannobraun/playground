# Tasks

- Build interactive mode into StackAssembly proper.
  I'm writing code here that loads a script and reloads it when it changes. This should be available in StackAssembly.
  Since this requires I/O and dependencies on external libraries, this should probably become a service library for hosts that is separate from the core interpreter library.
