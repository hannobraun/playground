## Notes

- What about weight?
  With just a plastic housing an internal PCB, it might become too lightweight to stay where it's put, considering the cable also has weight, and tension.
- The USB-C receptacle is best-placed on the left side, next to the button.
  A cable sticking out on that side won't get in the way when pressing the button, but it might very well get in the way when rotating the dial.
