## Notes

- What about weight?
  With just a plastic housing an internal PCB, it might become too lightweight to stay where it's put, considering the cable also has weight, and tension.
- The USB-C receptacle is best-placed on the left side, next to the button.
  A cable sticking out on that side won't get in the way when pressing the button, but it might very well get in the way when rotating the dial.
- The dial could have a non-linear control function.
  This would make precise adjustment, minute by minute, possible when turning it slowly, while allowing for fast changes over multiple hours when turning it faster.
- If practical, the dial should be continuous.
  That way, there's no problem switching between 23:59 and 0:00. I think there are continuous potentiometers. A rotary encoder might be an alternative.
