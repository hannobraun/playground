# Design

## Notes

- What about weight?
  With just a plastic housing an internal PCB, it might become too lightweight to stay where it's put, considering the cable also has weight, and tension.
- The concept drawing talk about the "dial" but that's not a good word.
  "Dial" implies a rotating display element involving a pointer, specifically a clock face. Given that this is also a clock, that is not a welcome association. As an input element, it evokes the thought of a rotary phone, which also isn't right.
  A better designation might be "control wheel", since "wheel" describes its form pretty well, and it's an input element for controlling the device.
- The USB-C receptacle is best-placed on the left side, next to the button.
  A cable sticking out on that side won't get in the way when pressing the button, but it might very well get in the way when rotating the control wheel.
- The control wheel could have a non-linear control function.
  This would make precise adjustment, minute by minute, possible when turning it slowly, while allowing for fast changes over multiple hours when turning it faster.
- If practical, the control wheel should be continuous.
  That way, there's no problem switching between 23:59 and 0:00. I think there are continuous potentiometers. A rotary encoder might be an alternative.
