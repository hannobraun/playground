# Design

## Notes

- What about weight?
  With just a plastic housing an internal PCB, it might become too lightweight to stay where it's put, considering the cable has weight on its own.
- Where to put the USB-C receptacle?
  If I want to have only one PCB, the left, next to the button, might be best.
- If USB-C receptacle is on the side, same side as button makes sense.
  A cable sticking out there won't get in the way when pressing the button, but it might very well get in the way when rotating the dial.
- How to attach front panel and PCB?
  I could screw them together, with screws from the inside (which I can access when detaching the front panel from the rest of the housing). But maybe they don't need to be attached? They can both be held in place from the side by the rest of the housing.
- The current design leaves empty space in the PCB.
  This doesn't really matter (air is free), but it doesn't seem elegant.
