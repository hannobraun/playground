# Design

## Notes

- What about weight?
  With just a plastic housing an internal PCB, it might become too lightweight to stay where it's put, considering the cable also has weight, and tension.
- The USB-C receptacle is best-placed on the left side, next to the button.
  A cable sticking out on that side won't get in the way when pressing the button, but it might very well get in the way when rotating the dial.
- How to attach front panel and PCB?
  I could screw them together, with screws from the inside (which I can access when detaching the front panel from the rest of the housing). But maybe they don't need to be attached? They can both be held in place from the side by the rest of the housing.
- The current design leaves empty space in the PCB.
  This doesn't really matter (air is free), but it doesn't seem elegant.
