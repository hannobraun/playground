# Playground

A personal playground for various experiments. Here I work on whatever I happen
to be in the mood for at the time. No expectation of ever finishing anything.

## Note on VS Code configuration

I've set `"rust-analyzer.check.allTargets": false`, because of a `no_std`
project. Once all `no_std` projects have been archived or moved out of the
repository, it might be a good idea to remove that again.
